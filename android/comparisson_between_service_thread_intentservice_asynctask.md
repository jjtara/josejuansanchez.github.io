## A comparisson between: Service, Thread, IntentService and AsyncTask

| | Service | Thread | IntentService | AsyncTask | 
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| **When to use?**  |- Task with no UI, but shouldn't be too long. <br><br> - Use threads within service for long tasks.  | - Long task in general. <br><br> - For tasks in parallel use Multiple threads (traditional mechanisms).  | - Long task usually with no communication to main thread. (Update) <br><br> - If communication is required, can use main thread handler or broadcast intents. <br><br> - When callbacks are needed (Intent triggered tasks).  | - Small task having to communicate with main thread. <br><br> - For tasks in parallel use multiple instances OR Executor (API Level 11  Introduces the `executeOnExecutor()` method).  |
| **Trigger**  | Call to method `onStartService()`  | Thread `start()` method  | Intent  | Call to method `execute()`  |
| **Triggered From (thread)**  | Any thread  | Any thread  | Main Thread (Intent is received on main thread and then worker thread is spawed)  | Main Thread  |
|Â **Runs On (thread)**  | Main Thread | Its own thread  | Separate worker thread  | Worker thread. However, Main thread methods may be invoked in between to publish progress.  |
| **Limitations / Drawbacks**  | May block main thread  | - Manual thread management. <br><br> - Code may become difficult to read  | - Cannot run tasks in parallel. <br><br> - Multiple intents are queued on the same worker thread.  | - One instance can only be executed once (hence cannot run in a loop). <br><br> - Must be created and executed from the Main thread.  |
