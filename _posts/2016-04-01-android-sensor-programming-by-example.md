I have collaborated with [Packt Publishing][1] as **book reviewer** of [Android Sensor Programming By Example][2], a great book written by [Varun Nagpal][3]. It has been a nice experience and I hope to continue collaborating with them in the future.

The book is available on [Amazon][4] and [Packt Publishing][2].
